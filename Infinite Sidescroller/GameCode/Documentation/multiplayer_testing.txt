If you want latest code to test online, merge&push to the branch gh-pages

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PUSH ONLY CODE THAT IS TESTED COMPLETELY. gh-pages SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN THE WORKING STATE (and as non-buggy as possible)
You can easily test all the stuff locally, with your own copy of the index.html page. Other people can test it with
you from their machines and their own copy of index.html, w/o need to deploy untested code to gh-pages
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You can use "normal" multiplayer mode through gh-pages or local index.html file as follows 
(if testing locally, replace the web address with local file address, like 
file:///home/zloyrim/Projects/SideScroller/Infinite%20Sidescroller/GameCode/index.html)

Parameters you need to pass on the query string are:
	player_id_array : array of id's for all players who are participating in the game (including yourself)
					  e.g. ["dukakes", "mark"]
	player_id		: your own player id
					  e.g. dukakes (notice absence of quotes of any kind)

Example:
	Player dukakes would use the following link:
		http://ali990.github.io/Multiplayer-Infinite-2-D-Side-Scroller/Infinite%20Sidescroller/GameCode/?player_id_array=["dukakes", "mark"]&player_id=dukakes
	Player mark would use the following link:
		http://ali990.github.io/Multiplayer-Infinite-2-D-Side-Scroller/Infinite%20Sidescroller/GameCode/?player_id_array=["dukakes", "mark"]&player_id=mark
